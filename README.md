## Introduction

The game of battleship involves two players placing ships on a grid and taking turns guessing the locations of each other's ships. The goal is to sink all the opponent's ships before they sink yours. This project focuses on developing a solver that uses metaheuristic algorithms to efficiently find optimal or near-optimal ship placements and guessing strategies.

## Installation

To use the Metaheuristic Battleship Optimizer, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/smoorf123/Metaheuristic-Battleship-Optimizer.git`

`cd Metaheuristic-Battleship-Optimizer`

Required Libraries:

`pip install numpy`

`pip install pandas`

`pip install copy`


## Usage

After installing the required dependencies, you can run the `Metaheuristic_Based_Battleship_Solver.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to use the battleship solver. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the solver and experiment with different metaheuristic algorithms and settings.

## Metaheuristic Algorithms

The solver in this project utilizes the Grey Wolf Optimizer developed by Seyedali Mirjalili, which can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965997813001853.

This algorithm is applied to find optimal or near-optimal solutions by iteratively exploring the solution space and improving the fitness of candidate solutions.

## Results

The results of running the metaheuristic algorithms on battleship problems are presented in the `Final Outputs` section of the notebook. You can explore the results to compare the performance of different algorithms and problem instances.
